/* This code will print the value of the variable "l" which is the quotient of the division of the variable "i" (which is initialized to 3) by -2, and the value of the variable "k" which is the remainder of the division of the variable "i" by -2.

In C and C++, when dividing two integers, the result is truncated (not rounded) to the nearest integer. For example, 3 / -2 = -1, and 3 % -2 = 1. This is the result of the division and mod operation in this code.

Therefore, the output of this code will be -1 1. */
