  switch (a)

}

/* This C program will output "Please subscribe my channel" and exit immediately after execution.

The program defines an integer variable a with a value of 10. The switch statement is used to test for different values of the variable a, but in this case, it does not have any case inside the switch block. So the program skips the switch statement and goes to the next statement which is a printf statement which will print "Please subscribe my channel"

In summary, the program will output "Please subscribe my channel" as the switch statement does not have any case to execute. */
