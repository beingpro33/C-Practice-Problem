/* This C program will output the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line, and then exit immediately after execution.

The program defines an integer variable i with an initial value of 1, and uses a for loop with an empty condition (for(;;)). This means that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.

Inside the loop, the program uses the printf statement to print the value of i and then increment i using the post-increment operator i++.

The program uses an if statement to check if the value of i is greater than 10. If it is, the program uses the break statement to exit the for loop.

Since the value of i is initially 1 and is incremented in each iteration, the loop will iterate 10 times, printing the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line, before the break statement is encountered and the loop is exited.

It's important to note that the for(;;) is an infinite loop and it should be used with caution, and make sure that there's a break statement inside the loop otherwise the program will run indefinitely.

In summary, the program will output the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line, and then exit immediately after execution, because the for loop is infinite and there's a break statement inside the loop. */
