/* This C program will print nothing and exit immediately after execution.

The while loop's condition is "i++ != 3", which will be false when i is 3, so the loop will not execute.

The loop's body contains the statement "printf("%d", ++i);" which will increment i by 1 and print the new value of i, but since the loop never runs this statement is not executed.

The final printf("\n") statement will print a newline character, but since there is nothing before this statement, nothing will be printed on the screen.

In summary, this program does not produce any output and exits immediately after execution. */
